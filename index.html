              Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT are complicating governments'
              efforts to agree laws governing the use of the technology.

            Indonesia's nascent generative AI sector faces challenges in scaling

          </h3>
          <p>
            Indonesia possesses the capacity to develop its own generative
            artificial intelligence (AI) models but it is currently limited to
            small-scale models, and unless the government is willing to step in,
            scaling up to more sophisticated models will be out of reach for
            many firms, never mind catching up with foreign AI developers.
